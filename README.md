Some Plots doesnt show i am trying to solve problem.
Conclusion
From OLS results we can say :
Player age affects to market value,because p_value= 0.002<0.05.
Page views affects to market value,because p_value= 0.000<0.05.

From Correlation matrix results we can say :
Player position has  correlated with a market value,because r=-0.217637 not 0.

A playerâ€™s market value can intuitively be represented 
       as : market value ~ popularity + position + age.
